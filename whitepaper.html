          Through the mystical energies of Heaven and Earth, the light of the
          Sun and Moon, the Mischievous Sun Wukong was hatched from a rock
          upon a high-top Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. After bowing in the
          four cardinal directions, Wukong opens his eyes to unwillingly shoot
          out beams of light into the mighty heavens and into Jade Emperors
          palace, alerting his entourage of the Monkey Kings awakening.
          <br /><br />Over a period of a thousand years, Wukong explores and
          adventures through the lands of Flower Fruit Mountain, up until
          being informed about the Peaches of Immortality located in the Jade
          Emperor’s Kingdom… <br /><br />The Monkey King’s quest for
          Immortality begins and after a long journey, Wukong finds the Gates
          to the Jade Emperor’s Kingdom and proceeds to barge his way in. Upon
          his entry into the garden of the Immortal Peach Trees, Wukong
          manages to pocket a handful of peaches before a battle between
          himself and the Jade Emperor’s Entourage begins. Days of battle ends
          with Wukong being blasted with a bolt of energy by the Jade Warlord
          in which the Monkey King is sent through a mystical portal. Wukong
          uses his clone technique to attempt an escape but is unsuccessful
          and gets pulled through the portal and into the metaverse.
          <br /><br />
          After arriving in the Metaverse, Wukong’s Fillet is missing and to
          his amazement Wukong has been cloned 4443 times. <br /><br />
          This begins Wukong’s new chapter of Journey to the Metaverse.

            Upon the Monkey Kings arrival in the metaverse, Wukong senses the
            radiating power of 443 Cloned Wukongs and sets out to join forces.
            Once connected, they chose to go through a sacred process of Merging
            using Immortal Peaches… little did they know, some were cursed, and
            others were blessed.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>How can I merge my two Genesis Wukongs?</strong>
            <br /><br />
            When the blockchain contract is live for merging, those holders who
            have been staking at least two of their Genesis Wukongs from the
            start of the staking contract will have accumulated the required
            $AURA to purchase a holy/cursed Peach which will be used to complete
            the merging ceremony. <br /><br />1. You will burn 700 $AURA to
            purchase a Peach off the JTTM marketplace.<br /><br />
            2. The peach will be completely random with a 50% chance of
            redeeming either a Holy or Cursed Peach.<br /><br />
            3. Burning the Peach and two Standard Genesis Wukongs will perform
            the descension into the pits of Hell or accession into the Heavens,
            resulting in an all-new Merged Genesis Wukong. <br /><br />4.
            Holy/Cursed peach + Standard Genesis Wukong x 2 = Merged Genesis
            Ascended or Descended Wukong<br /><br />
            5. There is no difference in the yielding of $AURA between Ascended
            or Descended Wukong.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>What will the Genesis Wukongs utility be? </strong>
            <br /><br />
            Each Wukong will yield the holder our native token $AURA. The Token
            will have no liquidity pair (could be changed in the future)
            However, as we continue to cultivate and grow in the space together,
            the overall utility and use case of $AURA will continue to expand.
            <br /><strong
              >**Disclaimer — The team will never ADD liquidity into $AURA**
            </strong>

            <br /><br />
            <strong>Priority Utility </strong>
            <br /><br />
            The main utility that will be recognized with the Genesis Wukong’s
            is that every item that is on a Genesis will be exclusive to the
            holders of that trait (Eg. If there is 5 Diamond Swords in the
            entire NFT collection, then only 5 will be available to be used in
            game). Those traits can be traded and sold separately on our
            secondary smart contract via Opensea. Through live metadata updates,
            selling/purchasing weapons or armor will reflect your Genesis Wukong
            NFT’s physical appearance.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Essential Utility </strong>
            <br /><br />
            Our Wukong holders will have access to new areas within the Discord
            for exclusive alpha calls from professionals in the space,
            fun/interactive events, giveaways and much more; including, but not
            limited to:<br /><br />
            · Collabs with high potential projects<br /><br />
            · Marketplace for merch and WL giveaways utilizing $AURA<br /><br />
            · High caliber artwork<br /><br />
            · Cross project integration<br /><br />
            There is much to develop with the use of $AURA and we look forward
            to hearing more of what the holders of JTTM want and following
            through with suggestions from community voting.

          The JTTM team have decided to provide our holders with two different
          options regarding staking to ensure that we are catering for everyone.
          Considering hard staking will occur a gas fee, the option of passive
          staking is available.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Hard Staking vs Passive Staking </strong>
          <br /><br />
          Holders will make the choice to either hard stake or passive stake
          their Wukong Genesis. The main difference between the two is that
          you’ll be earning more from Hardstaking than you would from Passive
          Staking.
          <br /><br />(Hard staking is like a fixed term savings account,
          whereas passive staking is your standard everyday savings account)
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Standard Genesis Wukongs </strong>
          <br /><br />
          Passive Staking 5 $AURA per day
          <br /><br />Hard Staking 15 $AURA per day

          <strong>Legendary Genesis Wukongs </strong>
          <br /><br />
          Passive Staking 25 $AURA per day
          <br /><br />Hard Staking 45 $AURA per day

          With Sun Wukong’s endeavor through the Jade Emperors Palace, the
          mischievous monkey pinched a few peaches from the Immortal Peach
          Tree’s & upon his entry into the Metaverse, Wukong pulls out the peach
          seeds from the peaches and plants them to turn into Immortal Peach
          Trees.<br />
          <strong>**To be claimed or purchased with $AURA — (TBA)** </strong>
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Peach Tree Utility</strong>
          <br /><br />
          The utility of the Peach Tree is very simple. Every Wukong NFT (Both
          Genesis & Gen 2) will grant its holder a NFT peach sapling that will
          grow into the peach tree upon staking. Peach Trees have 5 rarities:
          Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary. Each rarity will net a
          different number of peaches per week.
          <br /><br />
          <strong
            >Common: 3–5 Uncommon: 4–7 Rare: 8–10 Epic: 10–15 Legendary: 16–25
          </strong>
          <br /><br />
          By staking the Peach Tree, holders will be able to claim a custom
          resource called Peaches. Through the process of burning the claimed
          Peaches to be turned into $AURA, holders will have the chance of
          receiving the NFT of the next yet to be revealed Journey to the
          Metaverse character.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Peach Game Mechanics </strong>
          <br />
          Peach Game mechanics are simple and straightforward. Each Wukong
          Holder has the ability to snatch un-staked Peaches from other holders
          — however, the number will be randomized. The chances of your Peaches
          being snatched varies; the longer you hold your grown peaches, the
          lower the chance that your Peaches can be snatched.

          <strong>Play-To-Earn </strong>
          <br />
          Play-to-Earn will require you to hold a Wukong NFT granting you all of
          the functions, abilities and benefits available in the game.
          Non-holders can play, but the Play-to-Earn mode will not be available.
          Through project-to-project integration, we plan on allowing other
          projects members to have Play-2-Earn features but that will be
          expanded upon at a later date.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Secondary Market </strong>
          <br />
          Items from the game can be collected and sold on the secondary market
          (OpenSea) as standalone NFTs. The game mechanics will be expanded upon
          in our game whitepaper which will be released in the middle of Q2.
